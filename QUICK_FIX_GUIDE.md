## 🔍 How to Verify It's Working

### **Check 1: No Errors**
When you click analyze, you should see:
```
✅ FinBERT Model Loaded - Analyzing real-time sentiment!
```

NOT:
```
❌ Error: 'detailed_results'  ← This is FIXED!
```

### **Check 2: Real vs Sample Data**

Look at your **terminal** (where you ran `streamlit run main.py`):

**If using real data:**
```
✅ Using 10 real headlines for AAPL
✅ Using real earnings transcript for AAPL (15234 chars)
```

**If using sample data (fallback):**
```
⚠️  Only found 0 headlines, using sample data
⚠️  No earnings transcript found, using sample data
```

Both are fine! App works either way.

### **Check 3: Details Visible**

You should see:
- ✅ Expandable sections for positive/negative statements
- ✅ Individual confidence scores
- ✅ Full transcript viewer
- ✅ Each news headline with sentiment badge

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### **Still Getting 'detailed_results' Error?**

```bash
# Restart from scratch
cd "/Users/makwinglai/Desktop/Financial research tool"
./SETUP_COMPLETE_FIX.sh

# Then restart Streamlit
# Press Ctrl+C in the terminal running streamlit
streamlit run main.py
```

### **Not Seeing the New Page?**

Check that `main.py` has been updated:
```bash
grep "sentiment_analysis" main.py
```

Should show:
```python
from app import ... sentiment_analysis
```

If not, run the setup script again.

### **No Real Data Showing?**

This is OK! The app falls back to sample data. To use real data:
1. Check API keys in `.env` file
2. Test internet connection
3. Check terminal for error messages

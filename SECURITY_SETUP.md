# 🔐 Security Setup Guide

## ✅ Cleanup Status

All API keys have been removed from the codebase. Keys are now **ONLY** stored in:
- `.env` file (local development, ignored by git)
- Streamlit Cloud Secrets (for deployment)

---

## 🚨 IMPORTANT: Regenerate Your API Keys

Since your old keys were exposed on GitHub, **regenerate them immediately**:

### 1. Polygon.io
- Go to: https://polygon.io/dashboard/api-keys
- Delete old key: `LI9TBzQsYoq086df_BEZavff04P_HipZ`
- Click "Create API Key"
- Copy new key

### 2. newsdata.io
- Go to: https://newsdata.io/dashboard
- Find "API Key" section
- Click "Regenerate" or create new key
- Copy new key

### 3. API Ninjas
- Go to: https://api-ninjas.com/profile
- Find "API Key" section
- Regenerate key
- Copy new key

---

## 🔧 Update Your Local .env File

After regenerating, update your `.env` file:

```bash
# .env (local only - never commit!)
POLYGON_API_KEY=your_new_polygon_key_here
NEWS_API_KEY=your_new_newsdata_key_here
API_NINJAS_KEY=your_new_api_ninjas_key_here
```

**Never commit this file!** It's already in `.gitignore`.

---

## 📤 Re-upload to GitHub (Clean Version)

### Step 1: Delete Old Repository (if not done)

Go to: https://github.com/Billy131314141/Financial-research-tool/settings

Scroll to "Danger Zone" → "Delete this repository"

### Step 2: Create Fresh Repository

```bash
cd "/Users/makwinglai/Desktop/Financial research tool"

# Initialize fresh git repo
git init

# Add all files (except .env - it's in .gitignore)
git add .

# First commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Financial Research Tool (secure)"

# Create main branch
git branch -M main

# Add remote (create new repo on GitHub first)
git remote add origin https://github.com/Billy131314141/Financial-research-tool.git

# Push
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Verify No Keys in GitHub

After pushing, check these files on GitHub:
- ✅ `.env` should NOT be there (ignored)
- ✅ `.env.example` should be there (safe template)
- ✅ No API keys in any `.py` files
- ✅ No API keys in any `.md` files

---

## ☁️ Deploy to Streamlit Cloud (Secure Method)

### Step 1: Deploy App

1. Go to: https://share.streamlit.io/deploy
2. Sign in with GitHub
3. Select repository: `Billy131314141/Financial-research-tool`
4. Branch: `main`
5. Main file: `main.py`

### Step 2: Add Secrets (Your New Keys)

Click "Advanced settings" → "Secrets"

Add your **NEW** keys in TOML format:

```toml
POLYGON_API_KEY = "your_new_polygon_key"
NEWS_API_KEY = "your_new_newsdata_key"
API_NINJAS_KEY = "your_new_api_ninjas_key"
```

**Important:**
- Use quotes around values
- Format: `KEY = "value"`
- These are ONLY visible to you and your app

### Step 3: Deploy!

Click "Deploy" and wait 2-5 minutes.

## 🔐 How It Works Now

### Local Development:
```
Your App → Reads .env file → Gets API keys → Calls APIs ✅
(.env is never committed to git)
```

### Production (Streamlit Cloud):
```
Your App → Reads Streamlit Secrets → Gets API keys → Calls APIs ✅
(Secrets are stored securely, separate from code)
```

### GitHub (Public):
```
Your Code → NO API keys → Safe to share ✅
(Only .env.example with placeholders)
```

## ✅ Security Checklist

Before deploying:
- [ ] Deleted old GitHub repository
- [ ] Regenerated all 3 API keys
- [ ] Updated local `.env` with new keys
- [ ] Tested app works locally
- [ ] Verified `.env` is in `.gitignore`
- [ ] Created fresh git repo (no old history)
- [ ] Pushed clean code to GitHub
- [ ] Verified no keys visible on GitHub
- [ ] Added new keys to Streamlit Secrets
- [ ] Tested deployed app

---

## 🎯 Benefits of This Setup

✅ **Secure:** Keys never in public code
✅ **Flexible:** Easy to rotate keys (just update .env or secrets)
✅ **Shareable:** Code can be public, keys stay private
✅ **Professional:** Industry best practice
✅ **Portable:** Anyone can clone and add their own keys

---

## 📚 For Other Collaborators

If someone wants to run your project:

1. Clone repository
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
3. Add their own API keys
4. Run `streamlit run main.py`

They use **their** keys, not yours!

---

## 🚨 If Keys Are Exposed Again

If you accidentally commit keys:

1. **Immediately regenerate** exposed keys
2. Remove from code
3. Re-commit and push
4. Consider rewriting git history (advanced)

**Prevention:** Always check before committing:
```bash
git diff  # Review changes before committing
```

---

## 💼 For Job Applications

You can now safely:
✅ Share GitHub link
✅ Share live Streamlit URL
✅ Discuss code in interviews
✅ Show on portfolio

Your keys are safe! 🔒

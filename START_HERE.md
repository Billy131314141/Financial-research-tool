## ⏱️ IMPORTANT: First Load Times

**Because of rate limiting (5 calls/min free tier):**

| Feature | First Time | After Cache |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Market Overview | ~60 seconds | ✅ INSTANT |
| Stock Dashboard | ~45 seconds | ✅ INSTANT |
| Data Export | ~30 seconds | Downloads immediately |

**Why?** 15-second delays between API calls keep you safe from rate limits!

**Good News:** After the first load, data is cached for 1 hour = INSTANT access! 🚀

### ❌ DON'T:

**"Rate limit exceeded"**
→ Wait 2 minutes, don't click refresh repeatedly
